Wash 300 g of bone-in chicken well with water. It’s good to use chicken with bones to make clear soup as the bones add a lot of flavors. In case bone-in chicken is not available, use 200 g of boneless chicken instead. Add the washed chicken to a pressure cooker along with ¼ cup chopped onion, 3-4 cloves of garlic (smashed), ¼ cup of chopped carrot, 2 bay leaves, 2-3 sprigs of thyme, and 4 cups of water.
Add salt to taste and ¼ tsp of freshly cracked black pepper and pressure cook for one whistle on high heat.
Remove the pressure cooker from heat. Let the pressure release naturally and then open the lid of the cooker.
Strain the soup using a soup strainer.
Take out the chicken pieces and shred them into small pieces discarding the bones.
Add few shredded pieces in each serving bowl and pour the clear soup on top.
Garnish with spring onion greens. Serve hot.
