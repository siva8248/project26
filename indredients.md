Chicken – Get fresh chicken from the market to make this soup. Opt for chicken with bones as the bones release juice which makes this clear soup even more delicious.

Carrot – Love the flavor carrots give to the clear soup. You can also add some chopped celery.

Onion & Garlic – These two are the main ingredients of this soup, especially garlic. These two ingredients add up so much flavor, that no other ingredient can do. Also, go for freshly peeled garlic for the best flavor.

Others – Now, to season it a little bit we will add in bay leaf, thyme, salt, and pepper. Let’s keep it simple.

Also, I like to add freshly cracked black pepper as it tastes far better than the black pepper powder
